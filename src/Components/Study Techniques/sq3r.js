            What is SQ3R?
            SQ3R stands for survey, question (or query), read, recite, review. It is a method designed in the 1940s to improve reading comprehension.

            Here is the brief overview of each step:

            Survey: First, go through and get a lay of the land. Look at headings and subheadings, graphics, highlighted words, maybe summary paragraphs.
            Get an overview.

            Question/Query: Generate questions about the text that you can answer as you read it. These can be general (e.g. What is this section about?), more specifically targeted at the content of, say, the subheadings, or targeted at how the knowledge might be useful for your purposes.

            Read: Start actually reading, but as you do, use the questions that you generated above to create a more active reading process.

            Recite: Describe what you have just read. This could be done out loud or in written format, but try to recall everything in your own words.

            Review: Come back to the material again to review, trying to answer the questions that you generated before.</h2>
