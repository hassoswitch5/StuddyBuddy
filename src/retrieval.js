            Retrieval practice is the strategy of recalling facts, concepts, or events from memory in order to enhance learning.
            The act of retrieving something from your memory actually strengthens the connections holding it there,
            making it more likely that you'll be able to recall it in the future.
            A classic example of retrieval practice is using flashcards as a study tool. Sometimes called the “testing effect,”
            retrieval practice in teaching is not limited to quizzes or exams, but can include any exercise where students attempt
            to retrieve what they have learned from their memory.
            Evidence shows that retrieval practice is especially effective at increasing longer-term retention and generally outperforms more common strategies such as repeated studying or even more elaborate ones like concept mapping (McDermott, 2021; Karpicke & Blunt, 2011; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006). Research in classrooms demonstrates that retrieval practice is an extremely robust strategy across age groups and subject domains (McDermott, 2021). Retrieval practice also aids in higher-order thinking;
            it's not just for memorization. Students who use retrieval practice perform better on complex tasks and show improved metacognition
